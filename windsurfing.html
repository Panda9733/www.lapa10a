<p>Windsurfing, also known as sailboarding or boardsailing, is a surface water sport that combines elements of surfing and sailing. It consists of a board usually 2 to 3 meters long, powered by wind on a sail. The rider stands on the board and holds onto a boom attached to the mast, which is connected to the board via a universal joint. By adjusting the angle of the sail to the wind, the rider can control the speed and direction of travel.</p>
<p>Windsurfing can be practiced in a variety of water conditions, from flat water to waves, and is popular in coastal areas, lakes, and rivers. It requires a combination of balance, strength, and technique, making it both a recreational activity and a competitive sport. Windsurfing has various disciplines, including freestyle, wave riding, slalom racing, and long-distance racing.</p>
